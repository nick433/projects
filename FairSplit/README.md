Fair Split. Fare Split. Get it?

Nick spent $6.75 on light bulbs for the house, Julie spent $15.50 on a shower curtain, Gabbie spent $25 on toilet paper, paper towels, napkins. Wyatt and John didn't buy anything.

They are all too lazy to do math. Want to make a fair split and figure out who requests who how much money without any math or effort? The logic to figure out who should pay what to who is more complicated than it seems - check the python code

Plugging into this python script will tell you:

Gabbie will request $6.10 from wyatt

Gabbie will request $9.45 from john

Julie will request $2.70 from nick

Julie will request $3.35 from wyatt

everyone ends up paying $15.75
