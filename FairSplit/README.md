Nick spent $6.75 on light bulbs for the house, Julie spent $15.50 on a shower curtain, Gabbie spent $25 on toilet paper, paper towels, napkins. Wyatt and John didn't buy anything.

They are all too lazy to do math. Want to make a fair split and figure out who requests who how much money without any math or effort? 

Plugging into my program will tell you:

gabbie will request $6.10 from wyatt

gabbie will request $9.45 from john

julie will request $2.70 from nick

julie will request $3.35 from wyatt
