        <h1>About this extension</h1>

        This is currently a beta release with standardized ranges that reasonable players would play from each position.

        <br>
        <br>
        Important disclaimer thing: <span style="font-weight: bold"> Keep this on the DL. Seriously. </span> It is in the best interest of myself,
        you, and every
        competent poker player to not reveal the existence of this extension EXCEPT to other regs who you know irl that
        you trust
        would keep their mouths shut about this.
        <br><br> Even if you can logically arrive at this obviously not counting as cheating
        because it's just folding junk hands pre-flop,
        you will never be able to get everyone else to feel that way. Even if they *get it* they won't like the
        implication that
        this has for the game as a whole. Oh and if the moderators know you are using this it might be more than
        just negative sentiment and lower winrate that you'll have to worry about. If this becomes widespread and known
        about, Recreational players may very well feel like this is killing the
        fun of poker with everyone just playing "optimally" making them feel like why should they even bother playing
        just
        for fun anymore. Or they will just barely understand anything about it and think it's cheating. <div style="height: 15px"></div> Maybe the idea
        of a profitably optimal preflop range based on position hasn't occurred to them so now you've tanked your game's profitability just
        by more players becoming aware of
        the concept of preflop ranges affecting you and your reg friends' overall profitability. There is seriously no
        good that will come from
        sharing the fact that you use this with
        anyone. In fact, you can't even use this extension if you don't check the box below.
        <br>
        <br>
        <mark>I have read the above block of text starting at "About this extension" and I understand and agree that widespread knowledge of this would be bad
        profit-wise and reputation-wise for me, the seasoned skilled player,
        and the poker community as a whole. I agree to not share the fact that I use this or link it to other players as it will be detrimental to my winrate if spewers start nitting sweaters

        <h3> Why is this so awesome?</h3>
        </p>
        If you are trying to battle it out and play more hands, don't use this. But if you are multitasking with 1 or
        more
        poker tables while writing your college essay or doing work where longer intervals of uninterrupted attention
        would be valuable,
        this extension is for you. You would have longer intervals of attention toward those important tasks
        without hearing the *beep* it's-your-turn noise when you get 82offsuit the 3rd time this orbit, throwing off
        your focus and requiring you to
        navigate to the monitor with the table and hitting fold again &mdash; only to do the same thing on the next hand
        30 seconds later.
        <br><br> Maybe you have just one table open and are trying to play a video game and don't hear the first beep
        until the timer
        gets to the louder 3 beeps before folding. Good job you just held up the action again.
        <br><br> If only there was a way to have the junk hands which you would always fold anyway just fold on their
        own so you can
        go longer without your focus being broken on your work task (or show on netflix)
        <br><br>

        There's still occasional bugs being discovered or worked on but you don't have to worry about your aces being

        me in the hundred+ hours using this

        <br>
        The entire extension may break and require an update if the developer of pokernow makes updates which change the
        IDs for the elements on page or changes the order of sub-elements. Has happened a few times already. Contact me

    <h3> More Info</h3>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li style="max-width: 1100px">
            Everyone using this will have the same default ranges. The ability to select custom ranges will be a very
            involved feature to add as there are many considerations
            such as allowing users to set a custom button-defending range vs each position before it.
        </li> <br>
        <li style="max-width: 1100px">
            ********************************************************<br>
            The script will not raise or call for you, only fold in spots in which the user would ALWAYS be folding
            anyway, so a "bot" like this *should* be considered legal for most games but explaining
            that to people will be tedious and cause a headache or a ban so it's best you stfu about using this

    <h3> "Bugs"</h3>
    </p>

    <ul style="max-width: 1100px">
        <li>
            Sometimes when we call a single-raised pot from BB, because of the pot-size mutation observer, we will
            sometimes hit fold
            as soon as we call as it considers our own call as a 3bet. It's on the to-dos to fix this. But usually this
            doesn't matter because either A. We are closing the action so nothing happens (and would fold our
            non-3bettable hand
            to a backraise anyway). This could become an issue if we flat 76s and then one of the limpers decides to
            min-3bet and everyone else calls pricing us in.
            If this happens we can react to the fold-button turning red anyway so it's a low-priority bug
        </li> <br>
        <li>
            UTG will always have the beeping noise because the script takes between a third of a second and 1.5 seconds
            (randomized)
            to fold each hand [won't be fixing this btw]
        </li> <br>
        <li>
            Playing with straddles still occasionally will cause silent errors but the worst case scenario is that a hand
            that
            should be auto-folded preflop ends up not being folded
        </li> <br>
        <li>
            This isn't really even a bug but the run button will still show the activation color even if it fails to
            run.. just something to note
        </li> <br>

    </ul>

    <p>
    <h3> Future features</h3>
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li style="max-width: 1100px">
            You can start the extension while the game is idle/not started yet and regardless if you are seated or not.
            This usually makes an error because the script needs to detect the dealer-button on the table; which is why the script will
            always fail when there is a dead button since it's classified as a different element. I could debug this but it could take 
            me 2ish hours or so and it's such a rare edge-case - you can just fold that single hand on your own. 
        </li>  <br>
        <li style="max-width: 1100px">
            A little checkbox on the bottom left of the screen above the log/ledger button which allows you to
            automatically stand before you post your next BB
        </li> <br>
        <li style="max-width: 1100px">
            Be able to be more selective with continuing hands facing 3bets/4bets. For now all pocket-pairs will not
            auto-fold facing 3bets.
            <br> We also need to be more distinctive of whether or not the 3bet we are facing with pocket 6s is cold or
            is it against our 2bet?
        </li> <br>
        <li style="max-width: 1100px">
            Position-dependant continuing ranges <br>
            Ex: You might defend BB with A6o vs 4bb CO open but fold it to EP open. You might not fold AJo at SB vs HJ
            open but might want to fold it vs EP open
        </li> <br>
        <li style="max-width: 1100px">
            Being able to set custom ranges for each of the position v position situations. Maybe with some range chart
            drop-down. Each user of the extension will need a way to save their custom ranges
            which makes this much more complicated than just having my own hard-coded ranges.
        </li> <br>
        <li style="max-width: 1100px">
            ***Stretch goal***: if enough people are using this and willing to pay for this feature: Pot odds
            considerations so the decision to fold or not (preflop obviously) will be more dynamic by the bot but still be the same decision
            you
            would come to on your own. <br><br>
            Example: you have 66 at BB and a loose player who never 4bets (bot doesn't know this data-point) opens UTG,
            player after him 3bets to 3x, and then 3 other players flat the 3bet before you.
            You are getting pot odds to call here and folding would be too nitty. We want to not fold so tight and give
            the user the chance to decide if this flat is worth it or not depending on how TAG they think UTG is
            <br><br> Example2: You have k9s at the HJ 10 handed and have your ranges set to a nitty configuration that
            always folds this. You may elect to flat or limp along this hand if enough players behind also call. Using
            pot odds consideration would un-click (or re-click) fold button once the threshold to limp-along/flat has
            been met
